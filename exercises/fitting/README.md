All ```.txt``` files from Dr. Rafael Garcia's 2024 Honors Computer Modeling course

# How to Use
For each ```.txt``` file, try to write a program that fits a function. The name of the file should give you a hint. Once you have created a program, or if you are stuck, compare it to how I fit the data.

I've used three different methods
```
numpy.polyfit()
scipy.optimize.curve_fit()
scipy.optimize.leastsq()

My files require numpy, scipy, and matplotlib to be installed
```
